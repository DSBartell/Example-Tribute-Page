      <p class="trib-para">Griffith was born a poor pauper with nearly nothing. One day he met a strange woman who wore a strange token called a Behelit, <em>Egg of the King</em> around her neck. After much distant admiration, young Griffith inquired about the token. Little did he know, whoever had it was destined to one day make a choice between <strong>every single one of their friends, aquaintances and lovers</strong> and tuly unlimited power.</p>

        <p class="trib-para">Though Griffith wasn't particularly superstitious, the so called <em>prophecy</em> was enough for him to hold on to it as a good luck charm. He fought fearlessly to ascend through the ranks of both mercenaries and the royal army, meeting many a friend and foe along the way. It appeared eventually that the only way Griffith was going was up- leading to many assasination plots. Every single one was trounced by his friend Guts.</p>

        <p id="dream-quote">It is my perception that a true friend never relies on anotherâ€™s dream. A person with the potential to be my true friend must be able to find his reason for life without my help. And, he would have to put his heart and soul into protecting his dream. He would never hesitate to fight for his dream, even against me. For me, a true friend is one who stands equal on those terms.</p>

    <p class="trib-para">Even given his efforts, Griffith was brought to his knees with defeat and torture at the hands of his enemies. At his weakest moment he broke, triggering the Behelit. It was then that he decided that the only way to fulfill his dreams was to sacrifice all his friends to the mouths of hungry demons. Given his new found power- he empowers local villages, servants of justice & religious leaders <br><br><strong>But was it worth it?</strong></p>
